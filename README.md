# 1. My first LoRA finetuning project on - True or False Quiz Bot

**Dataset** -  Manipulated. Originally from Kaggle's "Open Trivia Database Quiz Questions All Categories" Dataset. (260 rows)

**Base Model used** - Tiny Llama ; Due to small training dataset (500 rows)

The quiz bot awards +1 points for the right answer and -1 points for the wrong answer, and also tells the total score after every question-answer round.
